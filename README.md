# Hagen_App

We developed an App for students to adjust when moving to a new country or city. This app shows all the things a student needs to settle in a new place wether it's the emergency contacts, university contact persons, grocery stores, hospitals etc. This app is inspired from my personal story, when I faced issues when moving to Austria for my semester exchange. The name comes from the city I was in "Hagenberg".
